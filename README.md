# HangmanWordle
Combines Hangman and Wordle games to create a new word guessing game

## Inspiration
We love word guessing games and so when we decided to try and develop a game, we started talking about our favorite games. We decided to combine two of our favorites and create a game which would essentially be a combination of the two.

## What it does
Allows a player six tries to guess a five-letter word.

## How we built it
We built it using Java and OOPs programming concepts.

## Challenges we ran into
We tried creating a GUI interface for the game for better user experience, however, we ran into issues that we could not solve in time for the submission deadline.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We successfully created a word guessing game that we really love!

## What we learned
We learnt that it's okay to not be able to reach all the right answers in time, and we'll continue to develop our game even after Technica ends!

## What's next for Hangman-Wordle
Successfully create a GUI interface for the game and maybe turn it into a website so that it's more easily accessible for more people to play.
